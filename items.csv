But if you want to watch something fantasy, you can't go wrong with Lodoss. One thing I didn't like about the show was the stupid chibi sections at the end of the episodes. It's just totally bizarre why it's included. I think it goes with the idea they overspent their budget and needed something to pad the episode.

The ones I watched on my first binge were: I Want to Eat Your Pancreas, Patema Inverted, Ride Your Wave, 5 Centimeters Per Second, Wolf Children, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, The Garden of Words, and Penguin Highway (...... oh and Fireworks, but didn't like that one)

So any movie recommendations similar to those? I'd love to have a list to randomly pick from. The only recommendations I could find were all movies that were connected to shows I haven't watched, I'd rather have something standalone.",0.6,1,0,1,t3_zhngyr

You can tell almost immediately that this was a passion project. The art is colorful and vibrant, the VAs are fantastic and the humor is objectively hilarious. So much memeable content. Not to mention, the music is pretty damn good too! 

The anime does a great job at making Bocchi very likable and also relatable to anyone with social anxiety. We’ve all been in painfully awkward situations before so you can’t help but to feel for the girl. You quickly become attached to all of her bandmates too. Very solid cast of characters.

52,52.0,,,,anime,Making a guess of what crunchyroll anime of the year will be,"I'm gonna be honest, I don't like crunchyroll. But since this is the only awards ceremony given to anime that I know of, I kinda have to participate. Based on what crunchyroll put out for nomination requirements, I'll try to guess the nominations as well as the ultimate winner.

Here are the most popular anime this year that were licensed by crunchyroll:

Ousama Ranking, Demon Slayer, Komi-San, Attack on Titan,  My Dress Up Darling, Kaguya Sama, Spy x Family, and Lycoris Recoil

&amp;#x200B;

Since there are only 6 nominees, I will choose the 6 most popular of these anime:

Attack on Titan, My Dress Up Darling, Kaguya Sama, Spy x Family, Lycoris Recoil, and Demon Slayer

&amp;#x200B;

Based on the cgi controversy, I doubt AOT will win. Demon Slayer and Kaguya Sama are unfortunately a bit older, so they lose to recency bias. That leaves My Dress Up Darling, Spy x Family(recency bias due to season 2), and Lycoris Recoil. This is where the prediction gets difficult. My Dress Up Darling somehow withstood the test of time with waifu power alone, so that's an anomaly, and while I think more people know about Spy x Family, Lycoris Recoil was deemed a masterpiece by everyone who did watch it. I think it will be a close match between the latter 2, but I believe Spy x Family will squeak out the victory.

Btw, this is NOT my personal favorite anime of the year(that award goes to Made in Abyss Season 2, WHICH ISNT ON CRUNCHYROLL FOR SOME REASON), this is just my prediction on who will win the popularity contest that is the crunchyroll anime awards

58,58.0,,,,anime,"I'm just really proud of the character design critique I made in this post so I wanted to make it a post to pseudo-brag about it. Btw, this is a post about Re:zero and my opinion of it","**(Has a few spoilers for things past the anime.)**  


I think Re:zero is a 7 overall and if you're really into the characters probably a 8. But I've got real picky tastes so me calling Re:zero 10/10 would be equivalent of saying it's so good that I can't even imagine a way it could be better.

Here's a few of my reasons. 

Re:zero (No matter how good you think it is.) is still a LN isekai. And so it contains a lot of same tropes that are really just their to make horny teenagers/adults buy it.

Easy example, the designs. Look at Emilia. Boobs are showing, skirt is ridiculously low (Like seriously some mini-skirt are longer then this), and for some odd reason the elbows are showing. (Hint it's erotic for some folk.)

Now I won't deny that the design is still good. Her clothes are regal and the white does a good job of symbolizing her purity, and maybe you could say that the open nature of her clothing gives a sense of youngness or jovial nature.

Even then, it's obvious that shit like the boob-window, short skirt, and elbows are made to be hot/sexy/cute/whatever. Why is this a problem? Because of the context/character Emilia is. If Emilia was some party girl or somewhat slutty girl or whatever combination you imagine that makes this then this design would make sense. And I'd defend it assuming other characters were given designs that fit who they are.

But Emilia's design does not make sense if we include her Character's situation and who she is (And the person that dressed her.). First off Emilia has no real friends at the start of the series, she literally does not know what sex is, and in arc 1-3 actively pushes people away either because she thinks she's trouble for them or that they inherently dislike her.

This character also has body image issues. (Can't look at mirrors, doubts Subaru whenever he compliments her on her beauty, looks like Re:zero version of satan.) She is not the type to want to show off her body, if anything she'd actively pick clothes that would not be eye-catching/cover her up either to avoid attention or to not disturb others with her body.

This is why I can safely say that Emilia's character design does not have Boob-windows or short skirts or exposed elbows because it's part of representing who Emilia is, or who she's forced to be. But because they knew a hot girl showing her tits on the cover would generate more sales.

(And yes you could use puck as a excuse but that's what it is, a excuse, because even when he's gone Emilia still wears that outfit. And its weird to think Puck would choose clothes that would actively make Emilia uncomfortable. And it becomes weirder/creepy when you realize this is pretty much a 14 year old being dressed by a 400 hundred year old to look like a 18 year old trying to get some dick.)

This is why I can not take most female designs in this series seriously, Elsa is the most atrocious example of this. She straight up looks out of a exotic porno and I'm suppose to be scared of her? No. I have never been scared by Elsa and I can safely say her design plays a big role in that.

And while the men are less obvious it is a bit funny to think that hardened combatants who've trained their entire lives like Julius look like pretty boys, and yes you could say that its intentional to his design in representing how perfect/flawless as a knight he is. But with how they treat the females? I'm not gonna give the story that sorta luxury.

Why do I hone in so much on the designs? Well it's because their one of the most objective show cases of a big problem in Re:zero. Which is that a lot of decisions in this story aren't that well thought out and are only their to either sell merch or keep the narrative that the author is trying to push. You'd think the latter would be a good thing, after all the narrative of Re:zero is why you're reading the story. And every narrative has some level of, (Well couldn't they do this instead? Why did this happen?) the problem is that a narrative which has too much of that can easily break suspension of disbelief and make the story feel forced/not natural/fucking bad.

Here's a few examples.

Remember when Elsa and Subaru were fighting and Subaru was able to block hits and not get speed blitz? Even though Subaru at this point is pretty much just a athletic human and Elsa is a faster then sound assassin?

The excuse Tappei gave is that Elsa was playing around with Subaru, but the truth is that he just didn't know how strong Elsa or anyone else in his series would end up being at that point. How do I know? Because when Reinhard shows up, takes care of Elsa, and then has Elsa have one final charge at Emilia. And Subaru is still able to keep up. Reinhard isn't able to get their in time/stop Elsa even though his way way way faster. (And you can't even say he was caught-off guard because the anime literally depicts him running to stop Elsa.)

It's obvious that Tappei either didn't know how OP Elsa would be or just didn't care about the massive power difference between Subaru, Elsa, and Reinhard. (I'm sure if you were meticulous enough you could apply this logic to plenty of fights in Re:zero.)

RBD and Subaru's painful deaths/torture is kept a secret. Which makes him feel alone and adds a bit of tragedy to his victories. (This solitude is especially true earlier on.) But Subaru can't talk about any of his deaths because he can't tell anyone he has RBD... but like we know Subaru can share information/use knowledge he learned in RBD to help others.

So like...

Why can't he say he has a ability that allows him to see into a possible future?

Or that his been cursed with a horrible magic that makes him every once in a while suffer fake but extremely painful deaths?

Or like a billion other explanations that would allow him to share his pain while preserving the secrecy of RBD? And yes at certain points Subaru probably doesn't even want to talk about his deaths to not burden his friends. But at other points he definitely wants to share at least some of the pain he feels.

Do we ever get Subaru trying multiple tactics to share his pain with others and failing either because no one believes him or the witch of envy stops him at ever turn? Nah. It's just impossible to share his pain, because if he could then a big drama in the series would be resolved. And the author either hasn't realized either how many ways Subaru still has to convey his pain or just doesn't care to try to showcase why it's impossible to do so.

Which in my opinion, makes the whole drama a bit stupid.

Subaru has had plenty of time in Re:zero in which his not under constant threat. And is technically rich (Roswaal would buy him whatever.) So like... this dude even after a full year of down time could not find a quicker and less painful way of dying then the ones his given on a sometimes daily basis? And when he does it's a painful poison (Arc 7) because he ""Doesn't want to get used to dying?"" Like he doesn't already shrug off fucking getting stabbed to death? 

The real reason is that it's a excuse for Subaru to die in whatever way the author wants him to die because if Subaru HAD a easy + painless way to die then he'd do it in a heart beat over getting eaten alive or frozen to death.

And I could go on and on and on and on about all the sorts of contrived reasons to why certain story decisions are made. But I hope know you can at least get some of the flaws of Re:zero. Or at least the flaws I see in it.",0.24,0,0,0,t3_zhjlon

75,,,,,,I don't understand Isekais,"I have trouble likeing Isekais, the only one I really liked where Rising of the Shield hero and Sword Art Online, Konosuba. I find the genre very repetitive, and I feel like every show in the genere is just the same thing with a different coat of paint. Mainly because it seems to follow the same exact formula  
\- Otaku gets sent to another world   
\-They have no other skill but gaming knowledge which some how works because the world they are in runs off it  
\-They become overpowered  
\-They get harem  
\-Enemies are generic evil demon lord that needs to be defeated  
\- set in genereic midevil fantasy world.  


I find it very just boring, and I want something new and exciting then an overpowered otaku fantasy.

I really liked it as it had no fan service, characters that had a developing arc between them with the wholesome friendships, and the beautiful music. Anime like this are what I’m looking for. I don’t really like completely episodic shows so that’s why I am asking for shows with some form of storyline like Yuru Camp has with good characters as well as good character relationships.",0.78,20,0,20,t3_zhdyr6

85,,,,,,Spy x Family (the anime) is failing Yor,"Disclaimer: I have been enjoying S2 of the show so far (except the 2 most recent episodes. I’m just not a fan of the obsessed Love interest 2 trope) and have always enjoyed our main trio. 

But I feel like Yor’s potential is being wasted. Her narrative arc thus far has been trying to be a better mother/wife primarily thru being a better cook. And while that in itself is interesting, it has gotten kind of trite to met at this point. There is an entire other dimension to her character (namely her assassin persona) that has yet to be really explored yet. Maybe we get more of it in S3 but it just feels odd that we’re closing on the end of the S2 and it’s still the same shtick from last season where, when compared against Twilight who has also had the whole trying to be a better dad arc but we also get to see the spy side of him. It just feels like Twilight is the star and Yor is relegated to being a mom when she’s clearly much more than that. And to me it just makes things more uninteresting

I also haven’t watched the latest episode. Maybe this gets addressed there",0.65,85,0,85,t3_zhbtt9
